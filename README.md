# CDMX Quiz, Mexico City Quiz

This is a quiz about Mexico City for everybody who would like to get some information about Mexico City. I've been living in Mexico City and I like many places there. Besides that there is a big community for foreigners and expats there. This quiz is good for those who would like to go to Mexico City or maybe already moved there and would like to get some tips. Mexico City is called CDMX, so I used it as a name of the project to make it short. 

CDMX Quiz is a project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In this project there are 6 questions. When the user answers the question correctly, the button turns green, when the user answers incorrectly, the button turns red. I also chose brand colors, you can read more about Project Brand color below and see the images.

## Features

I'll describe my project more in detail for you. Mexico is a very colorful country, so I used bright colors to make this brand design and to highlight the logo, Mexican flag, on the bright green yellow background. Especially rose-magenta colors, for example, there are buildings of these colors. It also reminds me of bugambilia flowers in Mexico.

### Existing Features

- __The CDMX Quiz Logo and Heading__

  - The logo is on the left at the top of the page, it's a Mexican flag, so everyone who knows it, will recognize it. I made it round, because I wanted to have a round logo. I used a Mexican flag on purpose so that it's clear at first sight that this is a project about Mexico. The heading is centered, the same as the quiz below to make everything more harmonious and user-friendly.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

I did different tests to make sure that the quiz project is user-friendly and easy to understand.

I added cursor pointer and hover color to the buttons, so that the user can see that he/she hovers and click the button and I used green color for correct answer and red color for incorrect answer when the user clicks the answer button.

Here is an iPad view as an example:

And a laptop example:

I've tried it in different browsers and it works well. 

I had to fix the bugs, when I was trying to change the button colors. The best idea was to change the text color to white when hovering. I also tried out some other colors.
