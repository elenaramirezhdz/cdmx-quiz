I utilised Chrome developer tools to build this quiz site and to check my ideas and to see if they work.

I checked the resposive funcionality of my quiz site using Google Developer Tools to see how it works on different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [index.html](testing/w3/w3-index.png) - Passed, though there was just one thing that I used a button for the score. I decided nevertheless to use my idea, because I like its look.

* [style.css](testing/w3/w3-css.png) - Passed, no errors found.

- Largest function has 10 statements in it, while the median is 2.
- The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 2 while the median is 1.
